title: ACP-226 Dynamic Minimum Block Times for Sub-Second Blocks
description: ACP-226 replaces per-block gas cost with a dynamic minimum block delay to enable sub-second blocks, align with validator preferences, and prepare the network for higher gas targets.

## What's Changing?

ACP-226 proposes swapping the old per-block gas cost for a simple, enforced minimum wait between blocks. New block header fields make 
sub-second blocks possible and keep spacing consistent. The delay naturally gravitates toward the stake-weighted median preference of
all validators (same control style as ACP-176), so cadence aligns with what validators actually want.

## Why Change the Current Mechanism?

The current gas check mechanism is overly complex and does not reliably prevent exceeding the target rate when priority fees already cover the
costs. No enforced minimum time between blocks can allow for bursts and risk periods of network instability.

ACP-226 introduces a minimum wait before the next block, enabling sub-second block production without network upgrades.

## How the Dynamic Delay Work?

The effective minimum delay uses a controller similar to ACP-176 with a dynamic Q parameter. Validators can set their
preferred minimum delay and the network will converge around the stake-weighted median. While the ACP-176 dynamic fee
mechanism still sets the target gas rate, ACP-226 reinforces network safety and prepares all the network's EVM chains for
higher gas targets and smoother UX.

## Looking Ahead

As gas targets climb, expect smaller, more frequent blocks and a snappier user experience. Streaming Asynchronous Execution (a.k.a. SAE, a.k.a. ACP-194) and ongoing
performance work make lower delays practical. We'll also share visuals that show how ACP-226 and ACP-176 fit together in practice.
