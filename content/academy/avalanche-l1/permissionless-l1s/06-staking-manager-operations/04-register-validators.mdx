This [state transition diagram](https://github.com/ava-labs/icm-contracts/blob/main/contracts/validator-manager/StateTransition.md) illustrates the relationship between Validators and Delegators.

### (PoS only) Register a Delegator

`PoSValidatorManager` supports Delegation to an active Validator as a way for users to earn staking rewards without having to validate the chain. Delegators pay a configurable percentage fee on any earned staking rewards to the host Validator. A Delegator may be registered by calling `initializeDelegatorRegistration` and providing an amount to stake. The Delegator will be registered as long as churn restrictions are not violated. The Delegator is reflected on the P-Chain by adjusting the Validator's registered weight via a [`SetSubnetValidatorWeightTx`](/docs/acps/77-reinventing-subnets#setl1validatorweighttx). The weight change acknowledgement is delivered to the `PoSValidatorManager` via a [`SubnetValidatorWeightMessage`](https://github.com/ava-labs/icm-contracts/blob/prorated-rewards-v2/contracts/validator-manager/MessageSpec.md#SubnetValidatorWeightMessage), which is provided by calling `completeDelegatorRegistration`.

> The P-Chain is only willing to sign a `SubnetValidatorWeightUpdateMessage` for an active Validator. Once Validator exit has been initiated (via a call to `initializeEndValidation`), the `PoSValidatorManager` must assume that the Validator has been deactivated on the P-Chain, and will therefore not sign any further weight updates. Therefore, it is invalid to _initiate_ adding or removing a Delegator when the Validator is in this state, though it _may be_ valid to _complete_ an already initiated Delegator action, depending on the order of delivery to the P-Chain. If the Delegator weight change was submitted (and a Warp signature on the acknowledgement retrieved) before the Validator was removed, then the Delegator action may be completed. Otherwise, the acknowledgement of the Validation end must first be delivered before completing the Delegator action. 

### (PoS only) Remove a Delegator

Delegators removal may be initiated by calling `initializeEndDelegation`, as long as churn restrictions are not violated. Similar to `initializeEndValidation`, an uptime proof may be provided to be used to determine Delegator rewards eligibility. If no proof is provided, the latest known uptime will be used (see [(PoS only) Submit and Uptime Proof](#pos-only-submit-an-uptime-proof)). The Validator's weight is updated on the P-Chain by the same mechanism used to register a Delegator. The `SubnetValidatorWeightUpdateMessage` from the P-Chain is delivered to the `PoSValidatorManager` in the call to `completeEndDelegation`.

### (PoS only) Submit an Uptime Proof

The [rewards calculater](https://github.com/ava-labs/icm-contracts/blob/prorated-rewards-v2/contracts/validator-manager/interfaces/IRewardCalculator.sol) is a function of uptime seconds since the Validator's start time. In addition to doing so in the calls to `initializeEndValidation` and `initializeEndDelegation` as described above, uptime proofs may also be supplied by calling `submitUptimeProof`. Unlike `initializeEndValidation` and `initializeEndDelegation`, `submitUptimeProof` may be called by anyone, decreasing the likelihood of a Validation or Delegation not being able to claim rewards that it deserved based on its actual uptime.

### (PoS only) Collect Staking Rewards
#### Validation Rewards

Validation rewards are distributed in the call to `completeEndValidation`.

#### Delegation Rewards

Delegation rewards are distributed in the call to `completeEndDelegation`.

#### Delegation Fees

Delegation fees owed to Validators are _not_ distributed when the Validation ends as to bound the amount of gas consumed in the call to `completeEndValidation`. Instead, `claimDelegationFees` may be called after the Validation is completed.


> How does it all work? I mean *actually* work.

### Sending Warp Messages

On the EVM, a warp message is simply an event log with `messageID = sha256(messagePayload)` Nothing is ever actually “sent” anywhere, which trips people up when first learning how Warp Messaging works.

The log event emitted is from the Warp precompile address (`0x0200000000000000000000000000000000000005`) The topic of the message will be `0x56600c567728a800c0aa927500f831cb451df66a7af570eb4df4dfbf4674887d` which is the output of 
```bash
cast keccak "SendWarpMessage(address,bytes32,bytes)"
```

To find a specific warp messageID, one must know the block number or block hash to retrieve the logs, or be monitoring all events, looking for and indexing messages. 

When a block is [accepted](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego/blob/master/graft/coreth/precompile/contracts/warp/config.go#L133) by the network, a precompile hook is called, and the EVM saves the warp message to a local database. The validator node will then be willing to sign any messages in that database upon request, typically via an `AppRequest` message over the p2p network.

### Receiving Warp Messages

On the EVM, any smart contract can call the precompile

which returns the warp message and verifies the attached signature. But what is `index`? Where does it get the warp message from?  The answer is, you!  When you send a tx to any contract that eventually calls `getVerifiedWarpMessage`, you **must** pass in the signed warp message as a “predicate”.  It’s called an AccessList, and typically this is an optional field that can be used by the EVM to pre-fetch storage slots that will be accessed, for efficiency and reducing gas costs. But Warp cleverly (ab)uses this feature of the EVM to verify the signature of the warp message, and then make the warp message available during the transactions lifetime, by calling `getVerifiedWarpMessage`. You can pass multiple warp messages which is where the `index` comes in.  (All of this is abstracted away by ICM for EVM to EVM comms)

Details: [Warp README](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego/blob/master/graft/coreth/precompile/contracts/warp/README.md)

### Interchain Messaging Contracts (ICM)

[ICM](https://github.com/ava-labs/icm-contracts) is a set of smart contracts that implements a rich messaging protocol on top of the Warp Messaging primitive, allowing for verified message passing between EVM chains. 

<Callout>
**Only (currently) supports EVM→EVM comms. Not used for EVM→P-Chain**
</Callout>

### Relayer

[Relayer](https://github.com/ava-labs/awm-relayer/blob/main/relayer/README.md) is an off-chain program that listens for warp messages on a source chain, and delivers them to a destination chain.  Messages can choose to be relayed by anyone, or by only privileged relayers. Messages can also pay fees to incentivize relayers and cover gas costs.

## Registering ValidatorManager

ACP-77 introduces L1-only Validators, that stake no AVAX, and do not validate the X/C chains. They must connect to the Primary Network and track the P-Chain, and also validate their own chain, and pay a small continuous fee in AVAX to the network.

User submits EVM tx to smart contract [NativeTokenStakingManager.sol](https://github.com/ava-labs/icm-contracts/blob/main/contracts/validator-manager/NativeTokenStakingManager.sol)

```solidity
function initializeValidatorRegistration(
        ValidatorRegistrationInput calldata registrationInput,
        uint16 delegationFeeBips,
        uint64 minStakeDuration) payable returns (bytes32 validationID)
```
Notably, this function will:

- Lock the native tokens in the contract
- `validationID`: bytes32 hash of an encoded `RegisterSubnetValidatorMessage`
- `messageID`: bytes32 hash of the warp message
- Store some data in the contract:


```solidity
$._pendingRegisterValidationMessages[validationID] = registerSubnetValidatorMessage;
$._registeredValidators[input.nodeID] = validationID;
bytes32 messageID = WARP_MESSENGER.sendWarpMessage(registerSubnetValidatorMessage);
$._validationPeriods[validationID] = Validator({
  status: ValidatorStatus.PendingAdded,
  nodeID: input.nodeID,
  startingWeight: weight,
  messageNonce: 0,
  weight: weight,
  startedAt: 0, // The validation period only starts once the registration is acknowledged.
  endedAt: 0
});
```

- Emit `ValidationPeriodCreated(validationID, nodeID, messageID, weight, registrationExpiry)`
- The `sendWarpMessage` precompile will emit a log with `sender`, `messageID`, `message`

At this point, we have submitted a transaction on the blockchain (C-Chain or L1, wherever the staking contract is deployed). All that has happened is we have stored some state in our contract and emitted some events. No changes to validators has occurred.

<Callout>
Nothing else will happen UNLESS an off-chain actor continues the process.
</Callout>


In our case, someone must be running a relayer that is configured with our staking contract as the source and the P-Chain as the destination.

<Callout>
At the moment, the relayer does not support the P-Chain, so messages must be signed and sent manually. The relayer will be updated soon to support the P-Chain.
</Callout>


So, to sign and send the message ourselves, we can use the Signature Aggregator server in the relayer project. This will use the p2p layer of the Avalanche network to connect to validators and send `AppRequest` messages to request each validator to sign a message.
```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/aggregate-signatures' \
--json '{"message": "<hex encoded unsigned message bytes retrieved from the logs>"}'
```
This will give us an aggregated BLS signature from at least 67% of the stake weighted validator set. Now we need to `POST` this to the P-Chain via the `RegisterSubnetValidatorTx` tx.

The P-Chain, if it accepts the tx, will “send” a Warp Message `SubnetValidatorRegistration` which acknowledges the change. Note that nothing is actually “sent”, instead the validator node will be willing to sign the unsigned message upon request.

So the next step is to use the Signature Aggregator service again, and provide the unsigned `SubnetValidatorRegistration` warp message, which the service will then ask validators to sign.

<Callout>
If your Validator Manager contract is on your L1 (instead of C-Chain), as an optimization, you only need to ask 67% of the stake weighted validators of your L1, not the entire P-Chain validator set.
</Callout>


Once an aggregate BLS signature is created, we need to submit the signed message to the C-Chain (or L1) by calling a function on the `ValidatorManager` contract.

```solidity
function completeValidatorRegistration(uint32 messageIndex)
```

Remember, this involves calling the function via `eth_sendTransaction` and encoding the signed warp message into the `AccessList`. (If you encode an array of 1 warp message, then `messageIndex` would be 0)

The function will adjust the state in the contract, including these bits:
```solidity
delete $._pendingRegisterValidationMessages[validationID];
$._validationPeriods[validationID].status = ValidatorStatus.Active;
$._validationPeriods[validationID].startedAt = uint64(block.timestamp);
```
And that’s it!

<Callout>
This doc is a WIP and we will eventually cover all the flows and add some diagrams.
