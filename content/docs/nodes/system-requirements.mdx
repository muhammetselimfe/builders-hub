## Primary Network Validators

Running a Primary Network validator requires careful consideration of your stake weight. Validators with higher stake receive more traffic and must process more data, requiring better hardware.

### Storage Requirements

<Callout type="error" title="SSD Required - No Cloud Block Storage">
You **must** use a local NVMe SSD attached directly to your hardware. Cloud block storage (AWS EBS, GCP Persistent Disk, Azure Managed Disks) introduces latency that causes poor performance, missed blocks, and potential benching. If running in the cloud, use instance types with local NVMe storage (e.g., AWS i3/i4 instances, GCP N2 with local SSD).
</Callout>

<Callout title="State Sync Recommended">
New validators should use **state sync** to bootstrap. While full sync from genesis is still possible, state sync is significantly faster—downloading only the active state (~500 GB) rather than replaying all historical blocks.
</Callout>

| Storage Type | Size | Description |
|--------------|------|-------------|
| Active State | ~500 GB | Current state required to validate. Downloaded via state sync. |
| Full Archive | ~3 TB+ | Complete historical state. Only needed for archive nodes or block explorers. |

### Hardware Requirements

Resource requirements scale with your stake weight. Higher stake means more validator duties and network traffic.

#### Low Stake Validators

For validators with modest stake delegations who want reliable operation without over-provisioning.

| Component | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **CPU** | 4 cores / 8 threads (e.g., AMD Ryzen 5, Intel i5) |
| **RAM** | 16 GB |
| **Storage** | 1 TB NVMe SSD (local, not network-attached) |
| **Network** | 100 Mbps symmetric, stable connection |
| **OS** | Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or macOS ≥ 12 |

#### High Stake Validators

For validators with significant stake who will handle proportionally more network traffic and validation duties.

| Component | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **CPU** | 8+ cores / 16 threads (e.g., AMD Ryzen 7/9, Intel i7/i9) |
| **RAM** | 32 GB |
| **Storage** | 2 TB NVMe SSD (local, not network-attached) |
| **Network** | 1 Gbps symmetric, low-latency connection |
| **OS** | Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or macOS ≥ 12 |

<Callout>
If you're unsure which tier applies to you: start with low-stake specs and monitor performance. If you see high CPU usage, memory pressure, or network saturation, upgrade accordingly.
</Callout>

## Avalanche L1 Validators

L1 validators run your own blockchain with custom parameters. Hardware requirements depend on your chain's transaction throughput and state size.

### Low Throughput

Suitable for testnets, development chains, or production L1s with minimal traffic (< 10 TPS average).

| Component | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **CPU** | 2 cores |
| **RAM** | 4 GB |
| **Storage** | 100 GB SSD |
| **Network** | 25 Mbps |
| **OS** | Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or macOS ≥ 12 |

### Medium Throughput

For production L1s with moderate activity (10–100 TPS average), gaming chains, or DeFi applications.

| Component | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **CPU** | 4 cores |
| **RAM** | 8 GB |
| **Storage** | 500 GB SSD |
| **Network** | 100 Mbps |
| **OS** | Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or macOS ≥ 12 |

### High Throughput

For high-performance L1s with heavy transaction volume (100+ TPS), large state, or complex smart contracts.

| Component | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **CPU** | 8+ cores |
| **RAM** | 16 GB+ |
| **Storage** | 1 TB+ NVMe SSD |
| **Network** | 1 Gbps |
| **OS** | Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or macOS ≥ 12 |

<Callout>
L1 validators sync the P-Chain to track validator sets and cross-chain messages. This adds minimal overhead to the requirements above.
</Callout>

## Networking

AvalancheGo requires inbound connections on port `9651`. Before installation, ensure your networking environment is properly configured.

### Cloud Providers

Cloud instances have static IPs by default. Ensure your security group or firewall allows:
- **Inbound**: TCP port 9651
- **Outbound**: All traffic

### Home Connections

Residential connections typically have dynamic IPs. You'll need to:
1. Configure port forwarding for port `9651` on your router
2. Consider a dynamic DNS service if your IP changes frequently

<Callout>
A fully connected Avalanche node maintains thousands of live TCP connections. Under-powered home routers may struggle with this load, causing lag on other devices or node synchronization issues.

- Learn about [Active State vs Archive State](/docs/nodes/maintain/chain-state-management) to understand storage requirements
- Set up [node monitoring](/docs/nodes/maintain/monitoring) to track resource usage
